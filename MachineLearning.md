Machine Learning.

Traditional Prgrams takes input, then process and gives output.
In machine learning, we provide pairs of (input, output) to train a model by learning a mathematical relationship. Once the model is trained, we can give it new inputs, and during inference it produces the corresponding outputs. (this is called Regression)

Machine Learning is a discipline in computer science where we train machines on data so that they can make predictions with out explicit programming.

but traning a Model with right data is importent.

Supervised Machine learning: once we have a data and we traine a model with that.

UN-supervised Machine learning: 

ML uses Neural networks to identify data 


Backword error propagation.

    Statistical Machine learning.
